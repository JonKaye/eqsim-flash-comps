This distribution contains the AS 2.0 version of the
Flash MX state engine, version 1.5 (FStEng v1.5), along
with the run-time visualization tool (RTVis) and the
statechart XML to code Window SWF.  The state engine and
tools are placed into the proper location when you open
FStEngOneFive.mxp with the Macromedia Extensions Manager
(version 1.6 and later).

The engine and tools are fully documented in a Help book
that gets installed with the code files.

This distribution also includes some fla files to test
and demonstrate the code.  The file TestCases.fla show you
some theoretical statecharts and how they are implemented
using FStEng v1.5, published to Flash Player 6 r65 and higher.

The file RTVTestCases.fla shows the visualization tool in action
displaying the structure of the test cases.  Run RTVTestCases.swf.
To see the structure of the first case, type in "mc1.se1" in the
text box next to Load Engine and press the button.  for the second
case, use "mc3.se1", and so on.

The distribution also contains Stolex5.fla, the analog/digital
watch originally built for our book, Flash MX for Interactive
Simulation: How to Construct Device Simulations (by Jonathan
Kaye and David Castillo, Delmar Thomson Learning, Nov. 2002).
